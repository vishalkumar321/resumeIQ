# ResumeIQ — Production-Grade AI ATS Resume Optimizer (Full-Stack SaaS)

A secure, multi-tenant SaaS application that analyzes resumes using AI, enforces row-level data isolation with Supabase RLS, and provides ATS-style optimization with role-based and job-description-based evaluation.

## Why This Project

Most resume tools provide static suggestions. ResumeIQ simulates an actual ATS pipeline by:

- Extracting raw resume text from uploaded PDF
- Applying AI-based semantic analysis via Groq (Llama 3)
- Comparing against structured job requirements in JD mode
- Returning strict JSON — **validated server-side before persistence**
- Persisting results securely per user using **Supabase Row Level Security**

This demonstrates backend security design, AI integration, and multi-tenant data isolation in a production-deployed application.

## Key Engineering Decisions

- **Frontend and backend separated** — clear trust boundary; backend never trusts client state
- **Supabase RLS over manual filtering** — user isolation enforced at the database level, impossible to bypass via API
- **Request-scoped Supabase client** — each request creates a user-authenticated client from the JWT, preserving RLS context for every query
- **Strict CORS + Helmet** — only whitelisted origins can reach the API
- **AI response validation** — Groq output is schema-checked before any DB write; malformed AI JSON is rejected with 502, never persisted
- **Service role key never exposed to frontend** — only the anon key goes to the browser; service role used only for server-side admin operations

## Security Architecture

### JWT Authentication Flow
```
1. User logs in → Supabase returns JWT access token
2. Client stores token in localStorage
3. Every API request: Authorization: Bearer <token>
4. verifyUser middleware calls supabase.auth.getUser(token):
   - Valid  → creates RLS-scoped supabase client (req.supabase)
   - Invalid → 401 Unauthorized
5. All DB queries use req.supabase — RLS enforces user isolation automatically
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)
RLS is enabled on all tables. Every policy uses `auth.uid() = user_id`:
- Users can only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE` their own rows
- No cross-user data is ever returned, even with a valid JWT from another user
- Storage objects are protected by path prefix matching against `auth.uid()`

**The backend never trusts client input. All AI responses are schema-validated before persistence to prevent malformed JSON from being stored.**

### Additional Security Layers
| Protection | Implementation |
|---|---|
| CORS | Exact-origin whitelist only |
| Security headers | Helmet (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options…) |
| Request validation | Zod schemas on every route |
| General rate limit | 100 req / 15 min per IP |
| Auth rate limit | 20 req / 15 min per IP |
| AI usage limit | 10 reports / day per user (DB-enforced) |
| Upload limit | 5 MB, PDF only |
| Password rules | Min 8 chars, upper, lower, number, special char |

---

## Cost Control Strategy

To prevent uncontrolled AI spend in production:

- Daily report generation capped at **10 per user**
- Limit enforced **server-side** via `COUNT` query scoped by RLS — cannot be bypassed by the client
- AI responses are **validated before persistence** — failed/malformed responses are rejected without DB writes
- File uploads capped at **5 MB** to prevent large payload abuse
- Groq's free tier (Llama 3) keeps AI cost near zero for small-scale usage

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Groq](https://console.groq.com) API key (free)

### 1. Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishalkumar321/resumeIQ.git
cd resumeiq

cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
# Fill in values
```

### 3. Set up Supabase
Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) in your Supabase **SQL Editor**.
This creates tables, RLS policies, storage bucket, and storage policies.

### 4. Start development
```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend (port 5000)
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 5173)
cd client && npm run dev
```

---

## Production Deployment

### Backend → Render
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root Directory | `server` |
| Build Command | `npm install` |
| Start Command | `node server.js` |
| Environment | All 6 vars from `server/.env` |

### Frontend → Vercel
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root Directory | `client` |
| Framework | Vite (auto-detected) |
| Environment | All 3 vars from `client/.env` |

> `client/vercel.json` handles SPA routing automatically — no manual config needed.

After deploying the frontend, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `FRONTEND_URL` in Render to your Vercel URL and redeploy.

---

## How Email Verification Works

```
1. User signs up → POST /api/auth/signup
2. Server calls supabase.auth.signUp() with emailRedirectTo: FRONTEND_URL/login
3. Supabase sends verification email
4. User clicks link → redirected to /login?verified=true
5. Login page shows "Email verified" confirmation banner
6. Login checks email_confirmed_at — unverified accounts are blocked with 403
```

---

## How JD Match Works

The AI receives extracted resume text + the pasted job description. The system prompt instructs Llama 3 (via Groq) to act as an ATS scanner and return **strict JSON only**:

```json
{
  "score": 60,
  "match_score": 40,
  "strengths": ["..."],
  "weaknesses": ["..."],
  "suggestions": ["..."],
  "missing_keywords": ["Node.js", "Docker", "..."]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `score` | How well the resume is formatted/optimized generally (0–100) |
| `match_score` | How specifically it targets the given JD (0–100) |
| `missing_keywords` | Terms present in JD but absent in resume |

The controller validates the response shape before any DB insert. Invalid AI output → 502 error, nothing persisted.
